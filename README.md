### My hobbies
I enjoy playing mainly indie games to see what cool ideas other programmers and designers are making, however I play lots of other games from lots of varying genres. My main hobby is playing chess and watching nature, crime and internet documentaries. I occasionally dabble in the Minesweeper speed running scene, a long term goal of mine is to beat expert in under 2 minutes (my best time is just under 3 minutes).
